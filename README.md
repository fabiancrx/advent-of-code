These repo contains the answers to the [adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com/2022) implemented with Dart.


#### Generate a day

The boilerplate for a new day can be generated by calling:
```sh
 dart run lib/gen_day.dart 
```
This will automatically generate the successive day 
Eg: last day at /lib/days/ is  7.dart then 8.dart will be generated.

Or if you want to specify a day you can too:
```sh
 dart run lib/gen_day.dart 11
```
